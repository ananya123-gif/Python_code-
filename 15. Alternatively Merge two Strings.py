# Given 2 strings, merge them in an alternate way, 
# i.e. the final stringâ€™s first character is the first character of the first string, 
# the second character of the final string is the first character of the second string and so on. 
# And if once you reach end of one string while if another string is still remaining then append the remaining of that string to final string 

# Examples: 
# Input : string 1 :"geeks"
#         string 2 :"forgeeks"
# Output: "gfeoerkgseeks"

# Explanation : The answer contains characters from alternate strings, and once 
# the first string ends the remaining of the second string is added to the final string

# Input :string 1 :"hello"
#        string 2 :"geeks"
# Output : hgeelelkos
